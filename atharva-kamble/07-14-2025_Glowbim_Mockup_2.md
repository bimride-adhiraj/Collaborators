📅 Day 1 Documentation – UI Deconstruction and Planning

🧭 Objective

The goal of the Day 1 task was to begin transforming a generic mobile UI into a Salon and Makeup Appointment App, tailored for beauty businesses and client booking needs.

🧩 Phase 1: Deconstructing the Provided UI

I began by analyzing the full UI reference image (uploaded) and identifying individual functional screens. These were captured as:

Home Page

Service Listing

Booking Flow

Booking Confirmation

Profile or User History

I used screenshot tools to divide the original image into individual screen-level visuals. Each screenshot became the foundation for a new page that could be redesigned and adapted for the salon business use case.

✂️ Screens Extracted

"Home Page" for service navigation

"Service Detail" for specific offerings

"Date/Time Selector" for appointment scheduling

"Confirmation" to display successful booking

"Profile" to show user data/history

Each screenshot was imported into Figma as a static layout for reworking.

🗂️ Design Goals Identified

After deconstruction, I noted several key UX requirements for the new salon app:

Simple navigation for first-time users

Highlight essential services (Makeup, Hair, etc.)

Booking confirmation and modification

Personalized user history

A rough sitemap was drafted based on these priorities.

🌐 Technology Planning

Though the mockup was built in Figma, I mapped potential HTML/CSS structure:

Flexbox-style layouts

Component-based spacing rules (margins, paddings)

Mobile-first responsiveness

🔚 Summary

Day 1 set the groundwork for the transformation. The original app layout was thoroughly divided, screens were isolated, and all content blocks were tagged for redesign. I now had a clear roadmap for developing the new salon experience.
