📅 Day 2 Documentation – Figma-Based Redesign for Salon Use

🧭 Objective

The goal of Day 2 was to repurpose the extracted UI screens into a fully redesigned mockup tailored for a Makeup & Salon Appointment Booking App using Figma.

🧱 Rebuilding UI in Figma

I imported each screenshot into Figma and began building editable mockups.

🔧 Tools Used

Auto-layout for CSS-style flex spacing

Grids to align sections consistently

Custom icons for makeup and beauty services

Font styling using sans-serif families for clean UI

🔄 Changes Made Per Screen

1. Home Screen:

Replaced generic icons with makeup brush, hair dryer, nail icon

Added text overlays for "Book Now", "Explore Services"

Styled CTA buttons with gradient fill matching salon branding

2. Services Page:

Card layout for three services: Hair Styling, Makeup, Skin Care

Added pricing tiers and quick book buttons

3. Booking Flow:

Date and time picker integrated using Figma components

Confirm button restyled with primary brand color

Used a realistic calendar and clock UI

4. Confirmation Screen:

Replaced success icon with star/beauty badge

Added QR code placeholder for appointment check-in

5. Profile & History:

Circular avatar display

Booking log with service, date, and price

🎨 Color Scheme & Typography

Primary color: Soft peach and pink tones for beauty branding

Secondary color: Muted grays for balance

Typography: Poppins and Open Sans for modern readability

🤝 HTML/CSS Equivalence

Each screen followed basic responsive logic, which can later be implemented using:

Flexbox rows/columns

Media queries for mobile behavior

Utility-first CSS classes (similar to Tailwind CSS)
