# 📁 Demand Forecasting with Time Series Breakdown

**Bimride Use**: Predicting ride demand trends to optimize surge pricing, driver allocation, and operational planning.

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement

In ride-hailing platforms like **Bimride**, knowing **when and where rides will be requested** is essential for:

- Ensuring enough drivers are available during peak hours  
- Adjusting fares dynamically (surge pricing)  
- Managing resources and improving customer satisfaction  

This problem is inspired by **time-series forecasting techniques**. While not a typical LeetCode problem, it relates to real-world applications of analyzing sequential data to predict future values.

## ✅ Final Solution (Python)

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example ride demand data (hourly)
data = {
    "hour": list(range(0, 24)),
    "rides": [15, 10, 8, 6, 5, 12, 30, 60, 80, 90, 110, 120,
              130, 125, 100, 95, 85, 70, 60, 55, 50, 40, 30, 20]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Calculate moving average (trend)
df["moving_avg"] = df["rides"].rolling(window=3, min_periods=1).mean()

# Plot demand trends
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(df["hour"], df["rides"], marker="o", label="Actual Demand")
plt.plot(df["hour"], df["moving_avg"], marker="x", label="Moving Average")
plt.xlabel("Hour of Day")
plt.ylabel("Number of Rides")
plt.title("Hourly Ride Demand Trend")
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

```

## 🧰 Data Structure
- **Pandas DataFrame** – Used to store ride demand data (hourly or daily).  
- **Moving Average Calculation** – Used to detect trends and smooth fluctuations.

### Key Variables:
- `rides` → Number of ride requests at each hour  
- `moving_avg` → Smoothed trend line for better prediction

## ⚙️ Time and Space Complexity

| Operation             | Time Complexity |
|-----------------------|-----------------|
| DataFrame creation    | O(n)           |
| Rolling average calc  | O(n)           |
| Plotting              | O(n)           |

- **n** = number of time intervals (hours/days)  
- **Space Complexity** = O(n) since all values are stored in memory.

## 🧼 Clean Code Practices
✅ Used **pandas** for structured data handling.  
✅ Added **rolling average** for trend smoothing.  
✅ Separated **data creation, calculation, and visualization steps**.  
✅ Clear variable names like `moving_avg` and `rides` improve readability.

## 🧠 Why This Matters for Bimride

1. **Dynamic Fare Optimization**  
   By identifying peak hours, Bimride can automatically increase fares when demand is highest.

2. **Driver Availability Planning**  
   Forecasting demand helps ensure enough drivers are active during busy times, reducing customer wait times.

3. **Operational Efficiency**  
   Demand prediction can guide marketing campaigns, ride discounts, and driver incentives for specific times.

## 🌍 Real-World Extensions
- **Advanced Forecasting** – Use ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM models for more accurate predictions.  
- **Geo-based Forecasting** – Forecast demand per location/zone for better resource allocation.  
- **Integration with Weather Data** – Weather can affect ride demand (e.g., rain increases bookings).  
- **Event-Aware Forecasting** – Festivals, concerts, and sports events can spike demand in specific areas.
