# 🔍 Understanding How Google AI Deep Search Works (Part 2)

## 🎯 Objective

To explore **how Google AI Deep Search generates its AI Overview answers**, what factors influence which sources and brands get featured, and how this impacts **Bimride’s chances of appearing in AI-generated search results.**

---

## 🧠 What is Google AI Deep Search?

Google AI Deep Search enhances regular search results by providing **AI-generated overviews** at the top of the page. Instead of just links, users see a **summarized answer with citations to sources.**

These overviews are built on:

* **Google’s Knowledge Graph** (structured entity-based data)
* **Search Index Ranking (E-E-A-T signals)**
* **AI summarization models (PaLM 2, Gemini)**

When users type **“Uber Barbados”**, Google Deep Search checks available sources and determines that **Uber is not operating in Barbados**, then suggests **competing services**.

## ⚙️ Key Ranking Factors in AI Overviews

### 1️⃣ Strong Entity Recognition in Knowledge Graph

* Websites with **structured data (Schema.org)** are more likely to be linked to entities like “ride-hailing”, “Barbados taxi services”, etc.

### 2️⃣ Topical Authority & Backlinks

* Google evaluates whether a website is **authoritative for a given topic**.
