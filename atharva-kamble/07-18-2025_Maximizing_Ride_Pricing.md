# üìÅ Maximizing Ride Profit with Optimal Pricing Strategy

**Bimride Use**: Determining the best time to set optimal ride fares based on market fluctuations  

---

## üö© Problem Statement  

In ride-hailing platforms like **Bimride**, drivers and the platform aim to maximize earnings by understanding the best time to "buy" (accept a ride) and "sell" (complete it for maximum profit).  

This problem is directly inspired by the **LeetCode problem "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock"** where you are given an array of prices, and you must determine the maximum profit achievable by buying on one day and selling on another day in the future.  

For Bimride, this concept can be mapped to understanding **ride price changes over time** and **optimizing the decision-making process to achieve maximum returns.**

## ‚úÖ Final Solution (Python)

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        min_price = float('inf')
        max_profit = 0

        for price in prices:
            if price < min_price:
                min_price = price
            elif price - min_price > max_profit:
                max_profit = price - min_price

        return max_profit

# Example Usage:
solution = Solution()
prices = [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
print(solution.maxProfit(prices))  # Output: 5 (Buy at 1, Sell at 6)

```

## üß∞ Data Structure  

- **Array (List in Python)**  
  Used to store the list of prices where each index corresponds to a day and its value to the ride price (similar to stock price).  

### Variables:  
- `min_price` ‚Üí Tracks the lowest price so far (best day to "buy").  
- `max_profit` ‚Üí Tracks the best achievable profit so far.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Time and Space Complexity  

| Metric | Complexity |
|--------|------------|
| Time   | O(n)       |
| Space  | O(1)       |

- **Time Complexity**: We iterate over the price list once.  
- **Space Complexity**: Only constant extra space is used.  

---

## üßº Clean Code Practices  

‚úÖ **Descriptive variable names** ‚Äì `min_price`, `max_profit` make the logic clear.  
‚úÖ **Single-pass solution** ‚Äì Efficiently updates values while iterating once.  
‚úÖ **Early comparisons** ‚Äì Reduces unnecessary operations by using `if-elif`.

## üß† Why This Matters for Bimride  

### 1. **Dynamic Fare Optimization**  
This logic is similar to detecting the best time to adjust fares. If demand is low (price dip), the system can incentivize riders, and when demand rises (price peak), fares can be optimized to maximize profit.  

### 2. **Driver Earnings Insights**  
Drivers can be shown data-driven suggestions on when to be active (e.g., avoid logging in at low demand hours and focus on peak pricing hours).  

### 3. **Operational Decision Making**  
Bimride can forecast potential earnings trends per hour or per day using historical ride price data.

## üåç Real-World Extensions  

- **Multiple Transactions**: Extend logic to allow multiple buy-sell operations for multiple rides in a day.  
- **Dynamic Demand Integration**: Combine with demand forecasting models for better decision-making.  
- **Geo-specific Fare Optimization**: Apply the algorithm separately for different regions.

## üöó Relevance to Bimride  

| Feature/Use Case           | How This Logic Helps                          |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Surge pricing decisions    | Detects price trends to set higher fares      |
| Driver work schedule       | Helps drivers know the best earning windows   |
| Business forecasting       | Predicts revenue potential per time interval  |

## üîö Conclusion  

The **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock** solution maps perfectly to **profit optimization for rides**. By tracking the lowest fare ("buy") and the highest difference ("sell"), Bimride can enhance pricing models, improve driver earnings, and forecast revenue potential efficiently.
