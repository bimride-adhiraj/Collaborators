# üìÅ Optimized Location Sorting with Trie

**Bimride Use**: Autocomplete for pickup/drop locations

---

## üö© Problem Statement

In ride-hailing apps like Bimride, the location search bar is critical. As the user types a pickup or dropoff point, the app should instantly provide location suggestions ‚Äî typically beginning with the same prefix.

To build this feature efficiently, we can use a **Trie (prefix tree)**, a powerful data structure designed to store and query strings based on shared prefixes. This solution is inspired by the LeetCode problem **"Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)"**, adapted here for real-time location suggestions.

## ‚úÖ Final Solution (Python)

```python
typing import List

class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_end_of_word = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word: str):
        node = self.root
        for char in word.lower():
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
        node.is_end_of_word = True

    def starts_with(self, prefix: str) -> List[str]:
        results = []
        node = self.root

        for char in prefix.lower():
            if char not in node.children:
                return []
            node = node.children[char]

        self._dfs(node, prefix.lower(), results)
        return results

    def _dfs(self, node: TrieNode, path: str, results: List[str]):
        if node.is_end_of_word:
            results.append(path)
        for char, next_node in node.children.items():
            self._dfs(next_node, path + char, results)

# Example Usage
trie = Trie()
locations = ["Bridgetown", "Bathsheba", "Barbarees Hill", "Bay Street", "Black Rock"]
for loc in locations:
    trie.insert(loc)

print(trie.starts_with("Ba"))  # ["bathsheba", "barbarees hill", "bay street"]
```

## üß∞ Data Structure

* **Trie (Prefix Tree)**:

  * Hierarchical structure of characters.
  * Enables fast prefix searches.
  * Avoids full string scans for every query.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Time and Space Complexity

| Operation      | Time Complexity |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Insert(word)   | O(m)            |
| Search(prefix) | O(m + k)        |

* **m** = length of word/prefix
* **k** = number of matched results

---

## üßº Clean Code Practices

* Encapsulated logic in `TrieNode` and `Trie` classes
* Used recursion for depth-first search in result generation
* Preserved lowercase consistency for case-insensitive search

---

## üß† Why This Matters for Bimride

### 1. Real-Time Autocomplete

* Users can quickly find pickup/drop points with just a few keystrokes.
* Improves user experience, especially in areas with multiple similar-sounding locations.

### 2. Scalable Location Indexing

* New locations can be added instantly without restructuring.
* Efficient even with thousands of addresses or landmarks.

### 3. Edge Case Handling

* Avoids issues like case mismatch, typo tolerance (extendable with fuzzy search).

---

## üåç Real-World Extensions

* **Fuzzy Search Integration**: Support partial matches or typo-tolerant results.
* **Geo-tagging**: Pair each location with latitude and longitude.
* **Multi-language Support**: Add parallel trie structures for localized name variants.
* **Location Rank Boosting**: Combine with ride history to prioritize frequently chosen places.

## üöó Relevance to Bimride

| Feature                       | Trie Benefit                           |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Address autocomplete          | Fast, prefix-based string matching     |
| Recent search history         | Can be integrated as prioritized layer |
| Driver-side destination input | Instant suggestions for route entry    |

## üîö Conclusion

The Trie-based autocomplete system makes location entry seamless in ride-hailing apps like Bimride.

By learning from the **Implement Trie** LeetCode problem, we gain a scalable, prefix-efficient, and user-friendly architecture for high-speed lookup. When deployed alongside geo-ranking or real-time feedback, this feature becomes a core part of trip-booking efficiency.
