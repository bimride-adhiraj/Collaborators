# Graph-Based Route Optimization for Bimride Dispatch

**Bimride Use**: Optimal driver routing in real-time for low-latency dispatch

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Bimride aims to reduce trip start times and route inefficiencies. To do this, drivers must be assigned to passengers such that:

* The route from the driver's current location to the pickup point is shortest in time.
* Congestion, distance, or tolls are factored into the routing decision.

This aligns perfectly with the classic **shortest path problem** in graphs—commonly solved with **Dijkstra’s algorithm**.

## ✅ Final Solution (Python)

```python
import heapq
from typing import Dict, List, Tuple

def dijkstra(graph: Dict[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]], start: int) -> Dict[int, int]:
    min_dist = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}
    min_dist[start] = 0
    heap = [(0, start)]

    while heap:
        dist, node = heapq.heappop(heap)

        if dist > min_dist[node]:
            continue

        for neighbor, weight in graph[node]:
            new_dist = dist + weight
            if new_dist < min_dist[neighbor]:
                min_dist[neighbor] = new_dist
                heapq.heappush(heap, (new_dist, neighbor))

    return min_dist

# Example graph (undirected weighted): node: [(neighbor, weight)]
city_map = {
    0: [(1, 4), (2, 1)],
    1: [(0, 4), (2, 2), (3, 1)],
    2: [(0, 1), (1, 2), (3, 5)],
    3: [(1, 1), (2, 5)]
}

# Shortest distances from driver location (node 0) to all pickup zones
shortest_paths = dijkstra(city_map, 0)
print(shortest_paths)  # {0: 0, 1: 3, 2: 1, 3: 4}
```

## 🧰 Data Structures

* **Graph as Adjacency List**: Each node maps to a list of `(neighbor, cost)` pairs
* **Min Heap (heapq)**: Efficient retrieval of current shortest node
* **Dictionary for distance tracking**: Tracks best-known path to each node

## ⚙️ Time and Space Complexity

| Metric | Value            |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| Time   | O((V + E) log V) |
| Space  | O(V + E)         |

* `V`: Number of intersections or nodes
* `E`: Number of roads or edges

---

## 🧼 Clean Code Practices

* Used Python’s `heapq` for priority queue behavior
* Maintains clear separation of graph input, algorithm logic, and output
* Optimized for early termination if needed (not shown here)

## 🧠 Relevance to Bimride Operations

### 1. Dispatch Optimization

Assigning the nearest driver to the rider in **real-time** is a shortest-path problem where each edge can be weighted by distance, estimated time, or live traffic.

### 2. Dynamic ETA Calculation

As trip demand increases or road conditions change, Bimride can re-run the shortest path algorithm periodically to refresh dispatch logic.

### 3. Fare Accuracy

Using actual route cost from shortest-path outputs ensures the fare reflects the real trip cost, improving transparency.

### 4. Zone-Based Driver Balancing

If multiple riders request pickups in nearby zones, the system can run multi-source shortest paths to match demand clusters efficiently.

## 🔄 Extensions for Production Use

* Use weighted graphs with **real-time traffic API data**
* Add **A* algorithm*\* for faster heuristic-based routing
* Build zone-to-zone matrix for **batch optimization**
* Integrate with map providers (e.g., Google Maps, OpenStreetMap)
* Cache common routes to improve dispatch speed

## 🚗 Bimride Impact Summary

| Use Case             | Dijkstra’s Role                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Fastest pickup       | Finds quickest driver-pickup path |
| Surge balancing      | Reroutes drivers to hot zones     |
| Multi-stop planning  | Chained shortest paths            |
| Trip fare validation | Route-based fare breakdown        |

This shows how even a classical algorithm like Dijkstra’s can have modern, scalable, and critical value in a real-world dispatch system like Bimride.

## 🔚 Conclusion

The graph shortest-path algorithm provides the foundation for **intelligent, scalable routing decisions** in ride-hailing platforms. For Bimride, this translates to:

* Faster trip launches
* Higher fleet efficiency
* Better rider-driver satisfaction

By combining graph theory with live data streams, Bimride’s backend gains a robust dispatching mechanism that adapts in real time.
