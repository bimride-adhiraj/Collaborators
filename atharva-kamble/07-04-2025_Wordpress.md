# 🌐 WordPress Exploration – Bimtech Solutions

## 🧭 Objective

To explore WordPress as a potential website development platform for Bimtech Solutions, an app development company. This phase was focused on platform familiarization and internal testing. No live website was built or published.

---

## ⚙️ What Was Done

* Explored WordPress through Hostinger’s one-click setup tool
* Navigated WordPress dashboard to understand theme selection, page creation, and plugin usage
* Tested page builder (Elementor) and plugin interfaces
* Did **not** host or publish a working website
* No content or design was shown to stakeholders

---

## 🏗️ Learning & Observations

### WordPress Strengths:

* Intuitive UI for beginners
* Drag-and-drop page builders (like Elementor) simplify design
* Large plugin ecosystem (e.g., WPForms, Yoast SEO)
* Built-in content structuring: pages, menus, posts

### Limitations in This Trial:

* Setup remained entirely local/test (no domain or hosting configured)
* No functional pages were created
* Images, branding, and copywriting not attempted
* Nothing was exported or presented to external teams

---

## ✅ Outcome

The exploration helped assess:

* How fast a beginner can adapt to WordPress tools
* Whether WordPress suits Bimtech’s non-technical stakeholders
* What kind of effort is required to launch a basic MVP site

> This experiment was strictly internal. It resulted in knowledge gain, but **no website was designed, hosted, or presented** at this stage.

This sets the groundwork for deciding whether WordPress is a long-term fit or if alternatives (like Hostinger’s native builder) should be explored further.
