# Merge K Sorted Lists

These 7 documentation ideas are designed to be simple yet meaningful. They align with Bimride's goals as a ride-hailing platform and can draw inspiration from software practices, Uber-like features, or relevant LeetCode patterns.

## 1. **Ride Dispatch Optimization via Heap-Based Matching**

**LeetCode Tie-In**: Merge K Sorted Lists
**Bimride Use**: Efficient driver-to-rider matching by minimizing ETA

---

### 🔍 Problem Description

In a real-time ride-hailing environment, we often have multiple queues of available drivers sorted by ETA for different regions. We want to combine these into a single stream of the top-k drivers with the lowest ETA for optimal dispatch.

This mimics the problem of **merging k sorted lists** using a **min-heap**.

### ✅ Full Working Code (Python)

```python
import heapq
from typing import List

def merge_k_sorted_eta_lists(lists: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    min_heap = []

    # Add the first element of each list into the min-heap
    for i, lst in enumerate(lists):
        if lst:
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, (lst[0], i, 0))  # (ETA, list index, element index)

    merged_result = []

    while min_heap:
        eta, list_idx, elem_idx = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        merged_result.append(eta)

        # Add the next element from the same list to the heap
        if elem_idx + 1 < len(lists[list_idx]):
            next_eta = lists[list_idx][elem_idx + 1]
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, (next_eta, list_idx, elem_idx + 1))

    return merged_result

# Test Case
eta_lists = [[2, 5, 9], [1, 4, 6], [0, 3, 8]]
merged = merge_k_sorted_eta_lists(eta_lists)
print("Merged ETA List:", merged)
```

### 🧠 Why This Matters for Bimride

This algorithm can power the backend of Bimride’s real-time dispatch engine:

* Continuously merge sorted driver queues from different regions
* Efficiently surface the driver with the lowest ETA
* Scale across thousands of drivers with minimal overhead

By leveraging a min-heap, we reduce the dispatch decision-making time drastically compared to brute force sorting.

### ⚙️ Time and Space Complexity

| Metric | Value                                           |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Time   | O(N log k), where N = total elements, k = lists |
| Space  | O(k), heap holds one element per list           |

### 🔚 Real-World Extensions for Bimride

* Integrate geolocation and driver metadata:

```python
{'driver_id': 'D981', 'eta': 4, 'lat': 13.0977, 'lng': -59.6145}
```

* Heap comparisons remain based on `eta` field only, but results can feed into:

  * Live ETA prediction models
  * Map visualization of drivers
  * Rider dispatch prioritization logic

This forms the backbone of a smart dispatching microservice inside any ride-hailing product like Bimride, ensuring both speed and fairness.
