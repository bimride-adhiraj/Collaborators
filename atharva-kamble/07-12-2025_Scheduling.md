# Trip Scheduling with Interval Merging

**Bimride Use**: Optimizing multi-passenger carpool rides or time-slot scheduling

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement

In multi-passenger ride-hailing scenarios such as Bimride’s carpooling feature, we often deal with overlapping pickup/drop-off time slots or ride durations. Efficient scheduling requires merging overlapping or adjacent time intervals to avoid redundant assignments and minimize idle driver time.

This parallels the classic **Merge Intervals** problem on LeetCode where given a list of intervals, we merge all overlapping ones into consolidated blocks.

## ✅ Final Solution (Python)

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def merge(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if not intervals:
            return []

        # Step 1: Sort intervals by start time
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        merged = [intervals[0]]

        for current in intervals[1:]:
            last = merged[-1]

            # Step 2: Check for overlap
            if current[0] <= last[1]:
                last[1] = max(last[1], current[1])  # merge
            else:
                merged.append(current)

        return merged

# Example
schedule = [[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
sol = Solution()
print(sol.merge(schedule))  # Output: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]
```

## 🧰 Data Structure & Logic

* **List of Lists**: Each interval is represented by a `[start, end]` pair.
* **Sorting**: Intervals are sorted by their start time.
* **Merging**: If current interval overlaps with the last added interval, merge them; otherwise, add the current one as new.

## ⚙️ Time and Space Complexity

| Metric | Value              |
| ------ | ------------------ |
| Time   | O(n log n) (sort)  |
| Space  | O(n) (output list) |

Efficient for processing large numbers of intervals, especially in real-time carpool matching.

## 🧼 Clean Code Practices

* Clear function name `merge()`
* Well-structured control flow
* Inline comments for clarity
* Handles empty input safely

## 🚗 Bimride Use Case

### 1. Carpool Scheduling

* Multiple users heading in the same direction may request pickups in overlapping time windows.
* Merging these ensures that a single carpool can be scheduled efficiently without redundancy.

### 2. Shift-Based Driver Allocation

* Merge driver availability windows to minimize shift gaps and maximize continuous coverage.

### 3. Route Block Planning

* Use interval merging to plan dispatch routes by grouping nearby pickups and drop-offs within a defined time frame.

## 🔄 Real-World Example

Suppose three users request a carpool:

* User A: 10:00–10:30
* User B: 10:15–10:45
* User C: 11:00–11:30

Merged intervals:

```
[[10:00, 10:45], [11:00, 11:30]]
```

This allows Bimride to batch A & B into one car and allocate a second trip for C.

## 🔍 Relevance to LeetCode

The LeetCode problem teaches key skills used in:

* Calendar management
* Scheduling services
* Traffic-aware dispatch
* Booking platform backend systems

The **Merge Intervals** pattern is not only foundational but directly applicable in ride-sharing platforms.

## 🔚 Conclusion

Interval merging is a powerful concept that helps simplify complex scheduling problems in real-time systems. In Bimride, this ensures:

* Efficient carpooling
* Better driver time utilization
* Scalable scheduling algorithms

By leveraging interval merging logic, Bimride can build smarter batching systems, offer faster matching, and provide smoother rides for passengers sharing similar schedules.
