# 📁 Checking Ride Schedule Feasibility – Meeting Rooms I Analogy

**Bimride Use**: Determine if a single driver can handle all scheduled rides without time conflicts.

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Given an array of ride time intervals, check whether all rides can be completed by a single driver without any overlaps.

This is based on **LeetCode “Meeting Rooms I”**, where each interval is treated as a meeting (or ride for Bimride). If any two rides overlap, a single driver cannot handle them all.

---

## ✅ Final Solution (Python)

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def canAttendMeetings(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])  # Sort rides by start time

        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            if intervals[i][0] < intervals[i-1][1]:  # Overlap detected
                return False
        return True
```

## 🧰 Data Structure

* **List of Intervals (Array)** – Stores ride start and end times.

### Key Variables

* `intervals` → list of rides with start and end times.
* Iteration compares current ride start time with previous ride end time.

## ⚙️ Time and Space Complexity

| Operation       | Complexity |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Sorting         | O(n log n) |
| Comparison Loop | O(n)       |
| Total Time      | O(n log n) |
| Space           | O(1)       |

---

## 🧼 Clean Code Practices

* Used **descriptive function name** `canAttendMeetings`.
* Sorted input once to simplify comparisons.
* Used early return on conflict detection to avoid unnecessary checks.

---

## 🧠 Why This Matters for Bimride

### 1. Preventing Overbooking

This logic ensures a single driver is not assigned two rides that overlap in time, avoiding scheduling conflicts and poor customer experience.

### 2. Ride Assignment Validation

Before confirming bookings, the system can verify if the existing schedule allows adding a new ride for a driver.

### 3. Operational Efficiency

This method helps in planning realistic driver schedules without requiring complex computations.

## 🌍 Real-World Extensions

* **Multi-Driver Scheduling** – Extend logic to assign multiple drivers when overlaps exist.
* **Priority-Based Scheduling** – Add ride priorities (VIP, long-distance) to decide which rides to keep in case of conflicts.
* **Integration with Maps & Traffic Data** – Consider travel time between rides for even more accurate feasibility checks.

## 🚗 Relevance to Bimride

| Feature / Use Case            | How This Logic Helps                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Single Driver Ride Scheduling | Ensures a driver is never double-booked     |
| Real-Time Booking Validation  | Prevents assigning overlapping trips        |
| Planning Driver Shifts        | Helps in efficient driver schedule creation |
