# 📁 Minimum Drivers Needed for Ride Scheduling – Meeting Rooms II Analogy

**Bimride Use**: Determine the minimum number of drivers required to handle all scheduled rides without time conflicts.

---

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Given an array of ride time intervals, find the minimum number of drivers required so that every ride can be completed without overlaps.

This is based on **LeetCode “Meeting Rooms II”**, where each interval is treated as a meeting (or ride for Bimride). The solution calculates how many drivers are simultaneously needed at any given time.

---

## ✅ Final Solution (Python)

```python
import heapq
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minMeetingRooms(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not intervals:
            return 0

        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])  # Sort rides by start time
        heap = []  # Min-heap to track earliest ending ride

        heapq.heappush(heap, intervals[0][1])  # Add end time of first ride

        for i in range(1, len(intervals)):
            if intervals[i][0] >= heap[0]:
                heapq.heappop(heap)  # Reuse driver if ride has ended

            heapq.heappush(heap, intervals[i][1])  # Assign current ride

        return len(heap)  # Number of drivers required
```

## 🧰 Data Structure

* **List of Intervals (Array)** – Stores ride start and end times.
* **Min-Heap (Priority Queue)** – Tracks ongoing rides by their end times.

### Key Variables

* `heap` → stores end times of currently active rides.
* The heap ensures we always reuse the earliest freed driver when possible.

## ⚙️ Time and Space Complexity

| Operation             | Complexity |
| --------------------- | ---------- |
| Sorting               | O(n log n) |
| Heap Push/Pop         | O(log n)   |
| Total Time Complexity | O(n log n) |
| Space Complexity      | O(n)       |

---

## 🧼 Clean Code Practices

* Used **descriptive function name** `minMeetingRooms`.
* Leveraged **heapq** for efficient end-time tracking.
* Early checks for empty input improve clarity.

## 🧠 Why This Matters for Bimride

### 1. Determining Fleet Size

This logic helps identify how many drivers are needed at peak times to avoid delays and unfulfilled ride requests.

### 2. Optimizing Resource Allocation

By calculating concurrent rides, Bimride can ensure enough drivers are active in specific zones.

### 3. Planning for Peak Hours

Operations teams can plan surge pricing and staffing during high-demand intervals.

## 🌍 Real-World Extensions

* **Driver Shift Planning** – Extend logic to create shift schedules that match demand.
* **Geo-Specific Allocation** – Apply logic per region or zone for localized scheduling.
* **Dynamic Pricing Integration** – Combine with demand forecasting to decide pricing based on driver availability.

## 🚗 Relevance to Bimride

| Feature / Use Case         | How This Logic Helps                                 |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Minimum Driver Requirement | Ensures correct number of drivers at any given time  |
| Fleet Planning             | Helps assign drivers efficiently across busy periods |
| Resource Optimization      | Prevents overstaffing or understaffing drivers       |
