## 📚 What I Studied Today

Today, I explored and compared two major project management tools — **Jira** and **Asana**. The objective was to understand their **core features, differences, use cases**, and evaluate which would better suit different teams or workflows — especially in the context of software development and ride-hailing product operations.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

### 📌 Jira

- Built primarily for **software development and agile teams**
- Strong focus on **sprint planning**, **issue tracking**, **Kanban/Scrum boards**
- Integrates deeply with **DevOps tools** (Bitbucket, GitHub, Jenkins, etc.)
- Powerful **custom workflows**, permissions, automation
- Best for **technical teams**

### 📌 Asana

- Built for **general project management** and **cross-functional teams**
- User-friendly with intuitive **task lists**, **timelines**, and **calendar views**
- Great for marketing, HR, operations, and business-oriented workflows
- Strong focus on **team collaboration**, **OKRs**, and **goal tracking**
- Best for **non-technical teams**
