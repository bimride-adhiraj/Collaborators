- **Business Domain Understanding**: Core product features, target audience, and market positioning

- **Process Documentation**: Standard operating procedures, quality guidelines, and best practices

Effective KT reduces onboarding time, minimizes knowledge silos, and ensures consistent quality across team outputs.
