# ðŸ“„ BimRide Admin Panel KT & Customer Support Case Resolution

**ðŸ“… Date**: August 4th, 2025  
**ðŸŽ¯ Objective**: Complete knowledge transfer on BimRide's admin panel and resolve real customer support case involving wallet balance management

## ðŸ§  What is Admin Panel Architecture in SaaS Platforms?

An Admin Panel (or Back-office System) is a secure web interface that allows authorized personnel to manage platform operations, monitor system health, and resolve customer issues. Key components include:

- **User Management**: View, edit, and manage customer and driver accounts
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Track payments, refunds, and wallet operations
- **Operational Dashboards**: Real-time metrics for rides, revenue, and performance
- **Support Tools**: Customer service utilities for issue resolution
- **System Configuration**: Settings management and feature toggles
- **Reporting & Analytics**: Data export and business intelligence tools

Modern admin panels use **role-based access control (RBAC)** to ensure security and **audit logging** to track all administrative actions.

        self.permissions = permissions
        self.session_timeout = 3600  # 1 hour
    
    def can_access_module(self, module_name):
        return module_name in self.permissions
    
    def log_action(self, action, target_id, details):
        # Audit trail for all admin actions
        admin_audit_log.create({

## ðŸ“Š Customer Support Case Study: Wallet Balance Resolution

### **Case Details**:
**Issue Type**|**Customer Impact**|**Resolution Required**
---|---|---
**Wallet Balance Discrepancy**|User unable to book rides due to incorrect balance|Investigate transaction history and update wallet

### **Diagnostic Process**:
1. **User Account Lookup**: Searched customer by phone/email in admin panel
2. **Transaction History Review**: Analyzed recent payments and ride charges
3. **Balance Calculation Verification**: Cross-referenced expected vs. actual balance
4. **Root Cause Identification**: Found failed payment processing that wasn't properly reversed
5. **Corrective Action**: Manual wallet adjustment with audit trail

### **Technical Resolution Steps**:
```sql
-- Step 1: Verify current wallet balance
SELECT wallet_balance, last_updated 
FROM users 
WHERE user_id = 'customer_id_123';

-- Step 2: Review recent transactions
SELECT transaction_id, amount, type, status, created_at
FROM wallet_transactions 
WHERE user_id = 'customer_id_123' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 20;

-- Step 3: Identify discrepancy source
SELECT ride_id, total_amount, payment_status
FROM rides 
WHERE user_id = 'customer_id_123' 
AND payment_status = 'failed'
AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL 7 DAY;

-- Step 4: Apply corrective adjustment
INSERT INTO wallet_transactions (user_id, amount, type, description, admin_id)
VALUES ('customer_id_123', 25.00, 'admin_adjustment', 'Refund for failed payment - Ticket #4502', 'admin_sanjeeth');

-- Step 5: Update user wallet balance
UPDATE users 
SET wallet_balance = wallet_balance + 25.00,
    last_updated = NOW()
WHERE user_id = 'customer_id_123';
```
