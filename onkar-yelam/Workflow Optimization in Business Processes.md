# Operations Skill: Workflow Optimization in Business Processes

## Overview
This project focused on learning and applying the principles of workflow optimization to streamline routine business operations. The goal was to improve efficiency, reduce manual intervention, and ensure smoother interdepartmental communication.

## Skill Focus
**Workflow Optimization & Process Mapping**

## Research & Learning Process

### 1. Conceptual Learning
- Read articles and whitepapers on Lean Six Sigma, operational bottlenecks, and Kaizen principles.
- Studied the theory of constraints and value stream mapping using resources from Harvard Business Review and Process Street.
- Watched YouTube tutorials on tools like Lucidchart and Miro for visualizing workflows.

### 2. Tool Proficiency
- Learned Lucidchart for creating detailed flowcharts of operational tasks.
- Practiced using Notion and Trello to build and manage workflows collaboratively.
- Explored Google Sheets automation features for routine tracking and reporting.

### 3. Application
- Identified a common operational inefficiency: redundant task approvals in a mock internal documentation workflow.
- Created a before-and-after process map highlighting delays and repeated steps.
- Proposed automation of approvals via Google Forms + Sheets + Email integration using App Script.
- Conducted a mock test run and documented a 25% reduction in turnaround time.

## Key Takeaways
- Streamlined workflows reduce friction between teams and lead to faster execution.
- Visualizing steps helps uncover hidden inefficiencies.
- Automating small tasks (like approval emails or report compilation) frees up time for strategic work.

## Outcome
This skill significantly improved my ability to analyze and optimize operational processesâ€”critical for any business analyst or operations associate role.
