**Date:** {date.today().strftime("%B %d, %Y")}

## Overview
I revisited and updated the Bimride logo to improve visual balance, scalability, and alignment with brand identity. This redesign focused on enhancing clarity, color harmony, and professional appeal for digital and print use.

## Objectives of Redesign
- Improve logo visibility on various background colors.
- Refine typography for better readability.
- Adjust proportions for better scalability on small and large screens.
- Ensure alignment with the startupâ€™s transportation theme and visual consistency across marketing materials.

## Process & Tools Used

### 1. Brand Research
- Reviewed branding guidelines and competitors' logos.
- Analyzed modern minimalist trends in transportation and tech startup branding.
- Identified primary and secondary brand colors that evoke reliability and energy.

### 2. Sketching Concepts
- Created hand-drawn concepts focusing on dynamic motion elements (arrows, roads, curves).
- Explored circular vs. linear framing options.
- Focused on simplicity while retaining uniqueness.

### 3. Tool-Based Redesign
- Used **Adobe Illustrator** and **Figma** for vector editing.
- Updated curves, spacing, and alignment with grid guidelines.
- Reworked typography using geometric sans-serif fonts to enhance modernity.

### 4. Feedback & Iteration
- Collected peer feedback on spacing, color tones, and logo feel.
- Iterated the design three times to address contrast issues and icon scaling problems.
- Re-exported files in multiple resolutions and formats (SVG, PNG, PDF).

## Final Outcome
- A refreshed Bimride logo that is professional, visually balanced, and on-brand.
- Fully scalable vector assets ready for GitHub, website, and marketing collateral.

## Next Steps
- Update README files and project documents with the new logo.
- Apply logo on business cards, slide decks, social banners, and web templates.
- Monitor feedback on logo perception from early users and potential customers.
