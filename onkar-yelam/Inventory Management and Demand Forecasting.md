# Operations Skill: Inventory Management and Demand Forecasting

## Overview
This task focused on understanding and applying demand forecasting techniques and inventory control methods to improve stock efficiency, reduce overstock, and minimize stockouts.

## Skill Focus
**Inventory Optimization & Forecasting Accuracy**

## Research & Learning Process

### 1. Theoretical Foundation
- Studied EOQ (Economic Order Quantity), ABC Analysis, and Reorder Point (ROP) models using Investopedia, Coursera, and MIT OpenCourseWare materials.
- Explored the bullwhip effect and its operational consequences on supply chains.
- Watched in-depth YouTube case studies from Walmart and Zara on lean inventory systems.

### 2. Tool Application
- Used Excel to build a sample EOQ calculator.
- Practiced time series forecasting models (like Moving Average and Exponential Smoothing) in Python using `pandas` and `statsmodels`.
- Simulated different demand scenarios using Google Sheets to understand stock fluctuations.

### 3. Real-World Simulation
- Created a mock business scenario: A seasonal apparel retailer with fluctuating monthly demand.
- Analyzed 12 months of simulated sales data to predict demand for the next quarter.
- Applied ABC classification to prioritize high-value SKUs.
- Set reorder thresholds and safety stock levels based on predicted volatility.

## Key Takeaways
- Inventory forecasting blends historical data with real-world variability—it’s both an art and a science.
- Effective inventory management reduces holding costs and improves customer satisfaction.
- Data visualization (via Power BI or Excel charts) helps stakeholders quickly understand stock health.

## Outcome
Gained confidence in using both analytical tools and business logic to optimize inventory—an essential skill for operations analysts, supply chain managers, and product ops roles.
