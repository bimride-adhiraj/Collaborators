## ðŸŽ¨ Logo Design Process

### 1. Understanding the Brand
- Defined Bimrideâ€™s identity as a modern, eco-conscious, commuter-friendly shuttle service.
- Outlined the brand values: simplicity, reliability, sustainability, and regional accessibility.
- Chose a visual style to reflect mobility and trustâ€”clear lines, clean typography, and a color palette suggesting motion and environment (e.g., blues and greens).

### 2. Research & Inspiration
- Analyzed competitor branding in transportation, ride-sharing, and eco-mobility sectors.
- Studied modern logo trends for mobility startups to ensure a fresh and professional look.
- Reviewed color theory to select tones associated with safety, technology, and sustainability.
- Looked into scalable logo formats suitable for digital platforms, social media, and web headers.

### 3. Design Execution
- Used [design tool used, e.g., Canva, Figma, Illustrator] to sketch multiple logo drafts.
- Focused on readability and adaptability across sizes (mobile, favicon, full header).
- Incorporated a custom icon representing transportation or shuttle movement.
- Finalized the version that balanced text + icon for strong brand recall.

## ðŸ§¾ GitHub Integration

### 1. File Preparation
- Exported the final logo in multiple formats (PNG, SVG) and resolutions.
- Named files clearly (e.g., `bimride_logo.png`, `bimride_logo.svg`) for easy referencing.

### 2. Repository Update
- Created or updated the `assets/` folder within the Bimride GitHub repository.
- Added both image formats into the assets directory for version control.

### 3. Markdown README Update
- Edited `README.md` to include the Bimride logo at the top for visual branding.
- Used Markdown syntax to embed the logo:
  ```md
  ![Bimride Logo](assets/bimride_logo.png)
